            # we color owners consistently by default, you can disable it via:
            # ColorSchemeByOwner => 0,

            # you can specify colors to use, unspecified owners will be
            # assigned to some color automatically:
            # ColorSchemeByOwner => { root => 'ff0000', foo => '00ff00' },

UPGRADING
  DateDayBeforeMonth
    Prior to version 1.02, there was an undocumented RT config option
    DateDayBeforeMonth. If you have DateDayBeforeMonth set in your RT, you
    can make JSGantt do the same thing by setting DateDisplayFormat in
    RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set(
            %JSGanttOptions,
            ...
            # DateDisplayFormat => 'dd/mm/yyyy',
            ...
        );
