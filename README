How to update jsgantt.js and jsgantt.css:

To make it work better with RT, we changed original jsgantt.js and jsgantt.css,
which can be found in jsgantt.diff.

If you want to update jsgantt.js and jsgantt.css to a new version, please 
review the diff to see what have been changed and maybe do the same change too.
