 - tweak the way we figure out Start/End Dates:
       Start: Starts or Started field
       End: Due Field

   If one exists but not the other, first try to caculate by the time
   estimated (or TimeLeft + TimeWorked) and the config
   $JSGanttWorkingHoursPerDay; if fails, use config $JSGanttDefaultDays.

   If both are not defined, find the minimal start date of the whole
   result, use it for both start and end dates, and use config
   $JSGanttNullDatesColor to draw

 - use TimeWorked + TimeLeft for progress, use TimeEstimated instead if
   TimeLeft is not defined.
